= x86-64 Implementation of "Programming from the Ground Up"

This repository contains the x86-64 implementation of the code from Jonathan Bartlett's "Programming from the Ground Up" (2003).

Original source code is written for x86. I have rewritten it for x86-64, GNU/Linux.

Make files for building and testing are included.
