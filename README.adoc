= x86-64 Implementation of "Programming from the Ground Up"

This repository contains the x86-64 implementation of the code from Jonathan Bartlett's "Programming from the Ground Up" (2003).

Original source code is written for x86. I have rewritten it for x86-64,
GNU/Linux, following System V ABI calling convention.
Files are named as `{ch}-{name}[-64].s`, where `{ch}` is the chapter number,
`{name}` is the program name and `[-64]` suffix is added for 64-bit binaries.
The lack of this suffix means the source is written for 32-bit mode.

Make files for building and testing are included.

== Build

Build tools should support both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries.

For Debian systems dependencies can be installed with the following command:

[,console]
----
$ sudo apt install build-essential gcc-multilib
----

Then you can build the repository with:

[,console]
----
$ make
----

== Test

Programs may be tested with the following command:

[,console]
----
$ make test-{name}[-64]
----
