= x86-64 Implementation of "Programming from the Ground Up"

This repository contains the x86-64 implementation of the code from Jonathan Bartlett's "Programming from the Ground Up" (2003).

Original source code is written for x86. I have rewritten it for x86-64,
GNU/Linux, following System V ABI calling convention.
Files are named as `{ch}-{name}[-64].s`, where `{ch}` is the chapter number,
`{name}` is the program name and `[-64]` suffix is added for x86-64 targets.

Make files for building and testing are included.
